# Starter folder

## Overview

This repo provides students with a foundation for their own projects associated with *Telling Stories with Data*. You do not need every aspect for every paper and you should delete aspects that you do not need.


## File Structure

The repo is structured as:

-   `data` contains the raw data as obtained from nflverse, the simulated data, the cleaned data for analysis as well as the data output by the model.
-   `models` contains the R script that runs and trains the model. 
-   `other` details about LLM chat interactions, and sketches.
-   `paper` contains the files used to generate the paper, including the Quarto document and reference bibliography file, as well as the PDF of the paper and the model card. 
-   `scripts` contains the R scripts used to simulate, download, test and clean the data.


## Statement on LLM usage

Aspects of the code and paper were written with the help of ChatGPT-4o. The entire chat history is available in other/llm_usage/usage.txt.
